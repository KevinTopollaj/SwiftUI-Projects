## Architecture

### MVVM

#### Model:

- The Model layer is responsible for representing the data from our business logic.


#### View:

- The View layer is responsible for handling all the layouts and displaying the data user-friendly. 
- The View knows the ViewModel but doesn't know the model.


#### ViewModel:

- The ViewModel layer is responsible for transforming the data received in a View-representative way, receiving actions from the View, and dealing with our business logic.
- The ViewModel Knows the Model layer but doesnâ€™t know the View layer.
- It contains data binding that tells whoever is listening about those changes using the Combine framework.
